Step 1/ Install PostgreSQL v8.4 (32-bit). This will create a user account called "postgres" in your Windows. Give a password.

Step 2/ Run pgAdmin III from Start --> PostgreSQL. Take a look "Databases". You should have only one default database called "postgres".

Step 3/ Run SetupDB.bat. You have to enter the assigned password in Step 1 twice. This will create a database called "CSDataBase" and some tables.

Step 4/ You can see the new database in pgAdminIII.
