 *
 * \section build_sec 2. Building LSHKIT
 *
 * NOTE: You don't have to build LSHKIT separatly if you only want to use the
 * library but not the tool programs.  Instead, you can directly merge the LSHKIT
 * source files to your project.  You can avoid installing CMake by doing this.
 * See Section 3.2 for details.
 *
 * LSHKIT requires the following libraries:
 * - Gnu Scientific Library
 * - [OPTIONAL] Boost Library > 1.36, the following packages are used:
 *   - program_options
 *
 * LSHKIT uses the CMake cross platform building system. 
 *
 * \subsection build_windows 2.1 Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2008
 *
 * The method would probably work for other versions of visual C++, but I haven't tested.
 *
 * You'll have to install GSL and CMake first if you haven't.
 * Refer to the following pages:
 *  - GSL: http://www.quantcode.com/modules/smartfaq/faq.php?faqid=33
 *  - CMake: http://www.cmake.org/
 *  
 * After installing everything, you still need the following configurations so
 * that CMake can find GSL:
 *  - Add an environment variable GSL_ROOT_DIR, so that \%GSL_ROOT_DIR\%\\include
 *    contains the GSL header files and \%GSL_ROOT_DIR\%\\lib contains the GSL libraries.
 *  - Copy the file lshkit\FindGSL.cmake to <CMAKE_HOME>\\share\\cmake-xxx\\Modules, where
 *    <CMAKE_HOME> is where you install CMake.
 *
 * If you have Boost installed in your system, you can choose to use your own Boost installation
 * instead of the minimal one comes with LSHKIT.  To do that, add an environment
 * variable BOOST_ROOT, so that \%BOOST_ROOT\%\\include contains the Boost
 * header files and \%BOOST_ROOT\%\\lib contains the Boost libraries.
 *
 * We are now ready to build LSHKIT.  Open the Visual C++ command prompt (by clicking
 * "Start/All Programs/Microsoft Visual C++.../Visual Studio Tools/Visual
 * Studio 2008 Command Prompt") and take the following steps:
 *  -# Create a building directory, which we call BULID_DIR, change to the directory.
 *  -# Run "cmakesetup <LSHKIT_DIR>", where <LSHKIT_DIR> is the LSHKIT root directory.
 *  -# The CMake setup window will show up.  Click the "Configure" button in the bottom of the window.
 *  -# Choose "NMake Makefiles" in the popup window and confirm.
 *  -# CMake will run for a while.
 *  -# After a list of red cached values show up, click the "Configure" button again.  You might
 *    want to change the value of some variables before that, for example, change CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
 *    from "Debug" to "Release" to enable optimization.
 *  -# The cached variables becomes gray now, click the "OK" button in the bottom.
 *  -# A Makefile has been generated, run "nmake" to make.
 *  -# The making process will last for a while.  After that, the LSHKIT library will be in the "lib"
 *    directory and the executables will be in the "bin" directory.
 *
 *  In Step 4, you can also choose "Visual Studio 9 2008" (or other versions) to create a project
 *  file, you that you can build using the Visual C++ IDE.
 *
 * \subsection build_linux 2.2 Linux
 *
 *  -# Copy the file lshkit\FindGSL.cmake to <CMAKE_HOME>/share/cmake-xxx/Modules, where
 *    <CMAKE_HOME> is where you install CMake, which is usually /usr.
 *  -# make a temporary building directory, change to it.
 *  -# Run "cmake LSHKIT_DIR", where LSHKIT_DIR is the LSHKIT root directory.
 *    You can also use "cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE LSHKIT_DIR" or "cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG LSHKIT_DIR" to specify the build type.
 *  -# A makefile should have been generated.  Run make.
 *  -# The making process will last for a while.  After that, the LSHKIT library will be in the "lib"
 *    directory and the executables will be in the "bin" directory.
 *
 * \section using_sec 3. Using LSHKIT in Your Project
 *
 *  Although the LSHKIT tool programs depends on boost_program_option to parse command line options,
 *  the main LSHKIT library only depends on the Boost headers.  If you use LSHKIT library in your project,
 *  you don't need to link to any of the boost library (unless you use them in other parts of your project). 
 *
 *  \subsection using_sec_1 3.1 Use LSHKIT as a library
 *  -# Build LSHKIT.
 *  -# Configure your building environment so that "LSHKIT_DIR/include" and the LSHKIT library can be found
 *    by your C++ compiler.  If you don't have Boost installed in your system, you'll also need to add
 *    "LSHKIT/3rd-party/boost" to your compiler's include file search path.
 *  -# Add "#include <lshkit.h>" to your C++ source code and you can use most of the LSHKIT functionalities.
 *  -# Link libgsl and libgslcblas (they may be named differently depending on your system) to your program.
 *
 *  \subsection using_sec_2 3.2 Directly add LSHKIT source to your project
 *  By directly using the LSHKIT source, you can avoid installing CMake.

 *  -# Configure your building environment so that "LSHKIT_DIR/include" and the LSHKIT library can be found
 *    by your C++ compiler.  If you don't have Boost installed in your system, you'll also need to add
 *    "LSHKIT/3rd-party/boost" to your compiler's include file search path.
 *  -# Make sure that GSL is properly installed in your system and your compiler can find the GSL header files.
 *  -# Add all C++ source files in "LSHKIT/src" to your project.
 *  -# Add "#include <lshkit.h>" to your C++ source code and you can use most of the LSHKIT functionalities.
 *  -# Link libgsl and libgslcblas (they may be named differently depending on your system) to your program.
 *

 *  (See the documentation of source files pointed to.)
 *  - The file format used by the tool programs: matrix.h
 *  - (Semi-)Automatic parameter tuning for Multi-Probe LSH and run benchmarks: mplsh-tune.cpp
 *  - Building a Multi-Probe LSH index: mplsh.h
 *  - Using LSH to construct sketches: sketch.h

 *  - The supported LSH classes: lsh.h
 *  - How to build complex LSH classses out of the basic ones: composite.h

 *
 * \section demo_sec 5. Demo Program Documentation
 * - scan.cpp
 * - lsh-run.cpp
 * - mplsh-run.cpp
 * - fitdata.cpp
 * - mplsh-predict.cpp
 * - mplsh-tune.cpp
 * - sketch-run.cpp
 *
 * \section license_sec 6. License
 *
 * LSHKIT is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).
 *
 * I do not intend to use the strict GPL license.  However, the performance modeling
 * part of the package depends on the GPLed Gnu Scientific Library for regression,
 * root finding and numerical integration.  If you want to use LSHKIT in your closed source
 * software and are willing to get rid of the performance modeling part (in principle,
 * you'll still be able to use it for performance tuning so long as you don't
 * distribute it; the tuning results can be hard coded into your non-GPLed
 * software), contact me and maybe we'll be able to work out a way.  
 *
